It introduces Python API commands\nfor authentication using API key and prompt inferencing using WML API.\n\n**Note:** Notebook code generated using Prompt Lab will execute successfully.\nIf code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute.\nFor details, see: [Saving your work in Prompt Lab as a notebook](/docs).\n\nSome familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.10.\n\n## Notebook goals\nThe learning goals of this notebook are:\n\n* Creating an access token from the IBM Cloud personal API key\n* Defining a Python class for calling the WML Foundation Model inferencing API\n* Using the class to generate output from a provided text input\n\n# Setup\n\n## Inferencing class\nThis cell defines a class that makes a REST API call to the watsonx Foundation Model\ninferencing API that we will use to generate output from the provided input.\nThe class takes the access token created in the previous step, and uses it to\nmake a REST API call with input, model id and model parameters.

Since 2011, we have served 310 children and adolescents in 28 reception services, carrying out around 5,000 'in loco' educational activities, complemented with 17 excursions and 41 external exploratory studies, with the support of 170 dedicated and committed eco-educator volunteers, working weekly for over one year continuously.\n###\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is Uno's Institute?\n\nAnswer:\nInstituto Uno is an education program focused on literacyfor children and adolescents sheltered in shelters, who are past the ideal literacy age.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the relationship between quero saber valor and Uno's institute?\n\nAnswer:\nUno's institute is financial education project that addresses two fundamental aspects, personal finance and behavioral finance, and offers opportunities for teenagers to organize and plan financially.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat's your belief?\n\nAnswer:\nIf you believe that educating is everyone's responsibility, Instituto Uno makes this possibility something possible and accessible to anyone who is willing to go through a transforming personal experience.
